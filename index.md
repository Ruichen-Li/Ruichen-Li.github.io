## Hello, this is Ruichen Li~

Thx for coming to my website:) You can call me Ruichen or Racheal if Chinese is too hard for you to pronounce.

### About me

Cool but not that cool, most of the time in sunny but sometimes low mood. (Be careful my low mood is contagious)

Yeah like most of the Chinese child, I learned to play piano at a very young age. Thanks to my mom's insist, now I have a very good taste in music and different kinds of art. Specially recommended hereï¼Œ*Chopin Ballades No. 1 in G minor, Op. 23* and the musical *Elisabeth*.

I will be very glad if you invite me to play sports. My table tennis, badminton and swimming are not bad, beginner leverl in tennis.:wink:

### About my research

Currently I am a yr1 PhD student in HKUST, both of my supervisors are of chemistry department. My interest is time series analysis of the Molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory, but I also helps on other projects in my group.

I got my Bsc in Beijing Normal University in 2021, majoring in Physics.
