## Hello, this is Ruichen Li~

Thx for coming to my website:) You can call me Ruichen or Racheal if Chinese is too hard for you to pronounce.

### About ME

![This is an image](https://i.ibb.co/Kxz0qFh/20220210142807.jpg)

Cool but not that cool, most of the time in sunny but sometimes low mood. (Be careful my low mood is contagious)

Yeah like most of the Chinese children, I learned to play piano at a very young age. Thanks to my mom's insist, now I have a very good taste in music and different kinds of art. Specially recommended hereï¼Œ*Chopin Ballades No. 1 in G minor, Op. 23* and the musical *Elisabeth*.

I will be very glad if you invite me to play sports. My table tennis, badminton and swimming are not bad, beginner leverl in tennis.:wink:

### About my research

Currently I am a yr1 PhD student in [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/), both of my supervisors are of chemistry department. My interest is time series analysis of the Molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory, but I also helps on other projects in my group.

I proudly received my B.Sc. degree in physics from [Beijing Normal University](https://english.bnu.edu.cn/) in 2021. My undergraduate research is under [Prof. Zuntao Fu](http://faculty.pku.edu.cn/fuzuntao/en/index.htm)'s supervison(if you like me pls click a like to Prof. Fu's homepage, he is such a warm professor, I learned a lot from him). At that time I focused on the nonlinear strength of time series based on phase correlation and the overestimated temporal irreversibility in NCEP reanalysis database. 

Paper here: **Li, R.**, Huang, Y., Xie, F. & Fu, Z. Discrepancies in surface temperature between NCEP reanalysis data and station observations over China and their implications. *Atmospheric and Oceanic Science Letters 14, 100008 (2021)*.[Online](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aosl.2020.100008)

My final year project is under [Prof. Fengjie Ma](http://virphysics.bnu.edu.cn/web/application/faculty/mafengjie/index.htm)'s supervison, the thesis is about high-throughput screening for materials with specific structure groups. By that time I already decided to join HKUST to do some material related physics, so this project is a try.

Keep question myself now: is material really interesting? Why I am here...

### About my social service

I served in the Youth Volunteers Association during my UG time and takes different kinds of responsibilities. Within three years of working in the Publicity and Interpretation Center, I worked as a volunteer docent in the Beijing Planetarium, the former residence of Soong Ching Ling and the Great Bell Temple Museum. Mentionly, in 2018 I was selected by our university to provide guide service for the *Great Changes - Celebrating the 40th Anniversary of Reform and Opening Up* large-scale exhibition in the National Museum. I also act as a teaching volunteer in the summer of 2019 in the *Central Primary School of Tongmu Town* in Pingxiang, Jiangxi. Providing help for others can really bring happiness and satisfactory to me.
